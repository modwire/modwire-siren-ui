# Delivery policy

After the user accepts completed work, update the linked GitHub issue and Project status. Merged pull requests must close their issue with `Fixes #<issue>`; then confirm the head branch is deleted remotely and prune its local tracking branch. Keep only protected long-lived branches unless instructed otherwise.

# Public-contract testing

`@modwire/siren-client` is the reference hypermedia consumer: inspect advertised
relations and actions before executing them. Test this package only through its
published `@modwire/siren-ui` imports and observable Siren UI documents and
snapshots; never cross the castle walls with private-module imports or assertions
about internal state. Apply Auntie order: adversarial boundary, invariant,
interruption, cleanup, and recovery cases before the happy path.

# Design rules

- Use OOP: one class per file.
- Do not add helper or pseudo-private functions.
- Functions are allowed only when they define the package public API (for example,
  an exported `createSirenUiEngine()`).
